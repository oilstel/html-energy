        <p>Yesterday, I woke up to an email that someone had sent us $5,000. I reread the Stripe email several times and blinked to make sure I wasn't still asleep.</p>

        <p>I quickly messaged Laurel about our new HTML angel...</p>
    
        <figure class="narrow">

            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
    
        <p>Over the course of the morning, I reasoned how this was actually possible and that it wasn't some accident.</p>
    
        <p>We had just organized <a href="/events.html">HTML Day</a>, a day where people meet up and write HTML in cities all around the world. These freewrites take place in parks, cafes, even boats. It's all about returning to the source of what made the web beautiful to begin with and writing HTML together in real life. Maybe our new angel had seen <a href="/goals.html">the potential</a> of our project. Maybe they realized how much unpaid work we had done over the last five years: organizing events, teaching people HTML, recording an entire <a href="/podcast.html">podcast</a>, keeping things <a href="https://x.com/htmlenergy">light</a>, all in the hopes of making the web a calmer and more human place to browse.</p>
    
        <p>Instead of eating breakfast at home, I decided to splurge on a nice cafe coffee and a croissant to celebrate ($5).</p>
    
        <p>The day passed as usual, and Laurel and I texted about how we could thank our angel. A special edition HTML Energy shirt, a gift basket of only green items, and, of course, a special certificate of appreciation all came to mind.</p>
    
        <figure class="wide">

            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
    
        <p>In the evening, a message arrived...</p>
    
        <figure class="narrow">
            <img src="from-angel.png" alt="HELP HELP PLEASE DECLINE MY PAYMENT THE MONTHLY WAS $50 I THOUGHT THE ONE TIME WAS ALSO GOING TO BE $50 PLEASE DECLINE MY PAYMENT">
            <figcaption>A message in all-caps arrives from our angel.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    
        <p>Alas, it had all been a mistake :(</p>
    
        <p>Our angel was just a smaller angel who had clicked through the support page a little too fast. Maybe if Stripe had more HTML Energy this wouldn't have happened.</p>
    
        <p>We promptly refunded our tiny angel and thanked them for their energy, though it saddened us that this was all a mistake.</p>
    
        <p>But this experience did make us wonder...</p>
    
        <p>Maybe a big angel did exist after all? It seemed so possible early that day. We had heard stories of projects being funded by a single bitcoin or a generous CEO. It really felt like our day had come.</p>
    
        <p>So the question still lingers with us...</p>
    
        <p><i>Who is the HTML Energy angel?</i></p>
