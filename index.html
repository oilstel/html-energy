            <p><span class="one">HTML</span> <span class="two">energy</span> is all around us and in this very website. building websites has become complex but the <span class="two">energy</span> of <span class="one">HTML</span> persists. What makes <span class="one">HTML</span> special is its simplicity. <span class="one">HTML</span> isn't a vast language yet you can do a lot with it. anyone who wants to publish on the web can write <span class="one">HTML</span>. This accessibility and ease of use is where it's <span class="two">energy</span> resides.
