                <h2>What is this?</h2>

                <p>This Sunday we will be trying a little experiment... if you can make it! We will be hosting an HTML freewrite, virtual style.</p>

                <h2>Schedule</h2>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>5-6pm</td>
                        <td>freewrite</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>6-7pm</td>
                        <td>hangout, share what you made</td>
                    </tr>
                </table> 

                <h2>What is a HTML freewrite?</h2>
                <p>We will be writing vanilla HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript together. The idea is pretty loose and self-directed. Come to the freewrite with a project in mind or just write in the moment.</p>

                <h2>How much HTML should I know?</h2>
                <p>It’s really up to you. It’s completely okay to use the freewrite to learn HTML if you are just starting out. If you get stuck you can try to ask the other writers for help.</p>

                <h2>Are frameworks/libraries allowed?</h2>
                <p>There’s nothing stopping you from using a framework but think of this as a time to get use the fundamental languages what made the web great to begin with. The intention of HTML Energy is to write, discuss, and share the power of writing documents/web pages on the www.</p>

                <h2>I write too much HTML at my job. Is there anything else I can do during the freewrite?</h2>
                <p>Why not teach someone HTML. If more people learned how to self publish on the web, we wouldn’t need many of the big platforms that people depend on to participate in the web today.</p>

                <h2>How to participate...</h2>
                <em>There are several ways to join us in real time during the freewrite:</em>
