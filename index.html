                   Ultimately, any attempt to describe HTML energy must come from what people actually experience at 
                   writing HTML.  
                   These <a href="podcast.html">testimonials</a>
                   remind us that writing HTML
                   can only be truly understood through

                   stands for Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.  These
                   four ideals are often touted as the elements that make writing HTML more
                   positive and life affirming than other kinds of markup languages.

                   Whether you believe that writing HTML is a spiritual revolution that is going
                   to change the world or just a chance to make a website,
                   the one thing we can all agree on is that writing HTML is

                   Though writing HTML is a spontaneous <i>of the moment</i> activity,
                   the ability to completely let go of our mental and emotional constraints
                   often depends on an underlying sense of security and safety.   Everything is
                   interconnected; love and respect involves being aware,

                   The things we do in our code editors
                   are not new or totally unique.
                   Nor does writing HTML happen in complete
                   isolation from other existing cultural forces.
