      HTML energy is all around us and in this very website.<br><br>

      Building websites has become complex,<br> but the energy of HTML persists.<br><br>

      What makes HTML special is its simplicity.<br><br>
      HTML isn’t a vast language, yet you can do a lot with it.<br><br>
      Anyone who wants to publish on the web can write HTML.<br><br>
      This accessibility and ease of use is where its energy resides.<br><br>
      Who’s writing HTML today?
