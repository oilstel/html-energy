            <p><span class="one">HTML</span> <span class="two">energy</span> is all around us and in this very website. building websites has become complex but the <span class="two">energy</span> of <span class="one">HTML</span> persists. What makes <span class="one">HTML</span> special is its simplicity. <span class="one">HTML</span> isn't a vast language yet you can do a lot with it. anyone who wants to publish on the web can write <span class="one">HTML</span>. This accessibility and ease of use is where it's <span class="two">energy</span> resides.
                
            <!-- The web has changed a lot over the years but for the end user, every website is rendered out as <span class="one">HTML</span>. For builders and mantainers, the web is becoming a little too complex. We believe that by writing <span class="one">HTML</span> in <span class="one">HTML</span>, we can get closer to it's <span class="two">energy</span>. After years of building websites that rendered as <span class="one">HTML</span>, we decided to only write the <span class="one">HTML</span> part. We could instantly feel the <span class="two">energy</span> of the web again. everything felt instant. Web authoring in real time! Of course, <span class="one">HTML</span> has it's downsides as does every language, but this page is only going to focus on it's <span class="two">energy</span>. you can feel it when you type it. each tag has its own life force. In combination with <span class="three">css</span>, <span class="one">HTML</span> is the ultimate web publishing tool.</p> -->

            <!-- <p>So how do we bring back the <span class="two">energy</span> of the web? Try writing a website in <span class="one">HTML</span> (and maybe some <span class="three">css</span>). Feel how much control you have over every part of your website. -->

            <!-- We want people to remember how it feels to write a website with no fuss. We want people to have <span class="one">HTML</span> <span class="two">energy</span> again.</p> -->

                <p>Raw html energy is easily communicated without words, but just in case you need to tell people about it, you could use the html energy emoji ❇️ or the unicode equivalent &#10055;.</p>
