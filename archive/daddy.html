                    <p>we have been talking with artists, educators, and developers on our podcast about how they use HTML and where they want to see the web go in the next 10-20 years. this is another way we've been making HTML more accessible to more people.</p>

        <i>why</i>

        <p>
            we believe that the best of the internet is yet to come. although we aren't really about web3 we believe that web3 people share many of the same values and ambitions as web0 people. we want to see a new less corporate web but we believe that it's already possible we just have to unlock it. we believe there is much to be explored when it comes to making websites. we also believe that through education and tooling we can bring things like (HTML & CSS) to more people. As educators and students we also strongly believe that people need to be inspired to pursue knowledge. In the past we've created directories of inspiring websites. We hope to do more of this type of work.
        </p>

        <h2>investors</h2>

        <p>
            We want to raise 300k. This will sustain our many initiatives. Crowd funded.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>dispel the belief that making websites has to be complex: we believe documents have power. while CSS is nice, it can be intimidating. let's keep things as simple as possible</p> -->
