            <h2>HTML is radical</h2>
            <p>
                When HTML was first invented it was mainly just a way for scientists to exchange information. It's grown a lot from those days and now it's often hard to see it through the layers upon layer of CSS and JS. We believe that making websites doesn't have to be complex and that anyone should have this tool in their toolbox. We believe that HTML has been marketed all wrong. It's not some techie language, it's the language of the web and now days we all speak www. So those that want to create new realities should go back to the source. HTML could be the language of the people. It's anti-bigtech, it anti-capitalist, it's all about sharing information.

            <h2>HTML is sexy</h2>
            <p>
                HTML doesn't have to be something that you'd never talk about on a first date. It could be the language of a new radical www movement. We've been calling it web0 but you can call it whatever you want. It could be the language of artists sick of promoting their work on social media looking for a more peaceful and posi places to exist online. HTML is political. HTML is anti-trump, anti-biden, anti-facebook, anti-twitter, anti-crypto, anti-bigtech. It's also anti-Tim Berners-Lee (the creator of HTML) and his stupid NFTs. It could be the language of the every day.
