            <h2>Education</h2>
            
            The educational goal: to teach people of all ages to write HTML. Our dream would be to get HTML into schools or curriculums.<br><br>

The human goal: to show people that the web is still alive. And to actively make the web more human and handmade.<br><br>

The connective goal: to celebrate practitioners and fans of HTML.<br><br>

The energetic goal: to reveal the raw energy of HTML. Approaching HTML as you would anything you excited about in life.
<br><br>
            HTML Energy's goal is to redefine HTML as a radical language instead of just something programmers use to build websites<br><br>

we want to connect with people that haven't ever written HTML before. we want to reclaim HTML from the tech overlords. HTML can be whatever you want it to be. it can be a love poem or a grocery list
<br><br>
one goal of @htmlenergy
 is to change people's perception of HTML. people should see it as a medium that allows for radical self-publishing. the cool kids should be wishing they spent more time traversing the DOM
