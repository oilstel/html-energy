                      Hi Neta and Ritu,
                      <span class="highlight"
                        >welcome to the HTML Energy podcast</span

                      encrypted message app Telegram, asynchronously over the
                      course of the weekend.

                    <p>
                      And just to jump in here,
                      <span class="highlight"
                        >I understand you both collaborated on a recent

                    <p>
                      Hi Laurel, thank you for having Ritu and I on your
                      podcast, HTML Energy. I’m super activated to see how the
                      voice memo format will bring light and shape to our
                      conversation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, to answer your question, and your series of
                      questions,
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> began out
                      of a shared frustration among friends, mutuals,
                      abolitionists, writers, coders, organizers, and
                      protesters on the ground like Nasma Ahmed, Priya
                      Prabhakar, Maha Shaista Ahmed, Elly Belle, and others
                      who have opted out of being named in addition to Ritu
                      and I.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And
                      <span class="highlight"
                        >we all came together under this shared annoyance and
                        frustration and anger, really, of seeing white and
                        non-black photographers treat protests and uprisings
                        as careerist opportunities to further their creative
                        practice or photography practice while simultaneously
                        endangering the lives of black protesters by making
                        them targets to the surveillance state</span
                      >
                      in the midst of what we’re all witnessing as the
                      bolstering and mass-proliferation and development of
                      facial-recognition technologies among other surveillance
                      technologies. And these photographers, like so many
                      other performative “allies,” we see as integral
                      extensions of the surveillance state and really feel a
                      need to challenge this performative allyship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And not only that, but
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> is an
                      ongoing effort to give a platform to resisting all
                      harmful forms of surveillance surrounding protests and
                      other collective actions by way of learning from
                      historical examples like
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO"
                        >COINTELPRO</a
                      >, which was an FBI program that actively and violently
                      targeted black organizers, activists, musicians, and
                      other public figures that continues to this day under
                      different names. So for me, and many of the other
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a>
                      collaborators, we knew
                      <s class="edit">many</s> organizers and protestors like
                      ourselves who were kind of on social media, using it to
                      disseminate and receive information.
                      <span class="highlight"
                        >It became this confusing jumble… Which source do we
                        go to? Which social media accounts have the latest
                        anti-surveillance tips or best protest practices? We
                        thought to consolidate all these disparate
                        anti-surveillance tips into a mobile-friendly website
                        paired with a social media account that could be
                        easily accessed before, during, and after
                        protest.</span
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My role in the project was part researcher, part
                      front-end developer and part back-end developer. We all
                      compiled our research findings in an encrypted document
                      using <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a>. And
                      then Ritu and I had a few collaborative design sessions
                      over FaceTime and text where we organized the content
                      into a design, which was mostly conceived by Ritu, using
                      <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>. And then I
                      hand-coded the designs with
                      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
                        >Visual Studio Code</a
                      >, Terminal, a node HTTP server, and
                      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"
                        >Firefox web browser</a
                      >. And then later on, I constructed a pseudo automated
                      sheet system on Google Sheets, which generates the
                      content on
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> through a
                      Python script. And from there, Ritu extended the
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> with a tool
                      called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which
                      I'll let her speak more to.

                    <p>
                      Thanks for having us, Laurel. I think HTML Energy’s
                      really cool. And it’s cool to talk about this project
                      and what we do on this platform in this way. And I’m
                      excited to see what you’ll do with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Yeah, so Neta forgot to mention that she brought me onto
                      the group. So I wasn't familiar with the collaborators.
                      And I hadn't spoken with them, but I was added to a
                      Signal group that was organizing this after Neta reached
                      out to me and asked me if I wanted to be involved.
                    </p>

                      For me, it was pretty interesting to be a part of this
                      in general because I do … do design and dev work. And I
                      also do event organizing that is in the spaces of
                      consciousness-raising around surveillance and technology
                      and big data, but I never really do design work with
                      organizers and abolitionists in this way.

                      Like a lot of times I work on things, or I'm asked to
                      work on things, and it's not researched as well as I
                      would hope. But it was just a really stellar group of
                      people, group of humans.

                      My role was designing the site, then building a database
                      via Jekyll to work with the back-end that Neta had
                      organized and then create posts. Jekyll is basically a
                      blog, so I created posts for the blog that spit out the
                      front end I designed. I use Jekyll a lot because it’s
                      really easy for me. You can make anything. You can make
                      anything with a really simple back-end.

                  <p>
                    I have a lot of thoughts on this. So I'll just say a few.
                    I think during this time, the architecture of the Internet
                    has been changing so rapidly.
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >In the context of organizing, tools like Instagram and
                      Facebook (mostly Instagram—I guess I don't know who uses
                      Facebook anymore), but there's been a ton of useful
                      information that's been posted on the platform.</span
                    >
                    It’s like Mark Zuckerberg making money, and uber
                    corporate, but
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >the proliferation and the circulation of information is
                      so accessible and easy when you're on a platform that
                      everyone has</span
                    >
                    and it isn't another website to go to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, I do think that as opposed to images,
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >websites are an amazing way of spreading information
                      because of how dynamic the information can be</span
                    >. Like I personally moved from graphic design to coding,
                    now that I look back on it, because I was a little bored
                    with how static image-making was. When you make a graphic
                    for Instagram or whatever—I’ve been seeing this
                    lately—<span class="highlight"
                      >when graphic designers make assets on Instagram for
                      good causes, there's a ton of comments telling them what
                      they got wrong about the image. But they don’t take it
                      down, and they can't change the image because of the
                      nature of the file and the medium.</span
                    >
                    But with something like a website, like you told me a bug
                    about it, and I could fix it in 10 minutes. Yeah, so I
                    think that there’s a lot of ways of looking at that.

                    Yeah, the changeability of websites is such an important
                    facet of them. I'm curious… what what were some of the

                    I've seen this mostly happening with information that's
                    either incorrect or disputed. Someone I know who's a
                    pretty like big graphic designer with a big following…
                    they posted an asset with a number that you could text to
                    get a message to a congressman about a specific issue
                    surrounding defunding the police. And the number changed.
                    The number that you should text changed, but the asset
                    also had a ton of other useful information. And I noticed
                    they didn't take it down, and it got a lot of traction in
                    circulation. So I wondered… what are the parameters of
                    usefulness and usability in these kinds of discussions and
                    contexts?

                    but organizers and abolitionists and other participators
                    in any kind of collective action or struggle… definitely
                    use websites and these platforms to communicate their
                    messages and contribute to an archive. When we're thinking
                    about an archive of resistance, I think websites and these
                    other platforms are 100% tools that have been utilized by
                    such people.

                    knowledge in terms of building my own website.” And so
                    those are all barriers that websites have and other
                    platforms have. Similarly, Instagram took all of us a
                    while to figure out. Twitter also took us a while to

                    Cool. Yeah, that's a really good point that all of these
                    tools are extensions of more based communication methods,
                    that can actually be just as good if not better depending
                    on how you use them.

                    >
                    And it's funny. I feel like this relates to a question I
                    had actually written down before. I'd wanted to ask you
                    both about why
                    <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> was mostly
                    text-based, but now based on what Ritu said about the
                    images and, you know, this ability for the website to
                    change, I understand now why it's text based. But maybe
                    going to what you said, Neta… a downside to a website is
                    that there are all these things you need. Like you need to
                    have internet, and maybe you even need to have good
                    internet. I was thinking maybe an answer to the text-based
                    website (question) is that it is pretty fast to load. And

                  <p>
                    Yeah, just to follow up on the previous question and the
                    comment that I made about an
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >“archive of resistance.” And really, we can think about
                      this in another way, which is
                      <s class="edit">just</s> an archive of resistance is a
                      movement. And <s class="edit">thinking about</s>
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> is sitting
                      on top of all this historical and ancestral knowledge
                      pertaining to the movement for black lives or the black
                      freedom struggle. There's a lot of research and
                      theorizing that many people before us, Ritu and I, and
                      other collaborators of
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> have pulled
                      from. So that citational practice is something that we
                      tried to be more transparent about, or more clear about.
                      In the way that you maybe can't be as transparent on
                      something like Instagram posts. These (Instagram)
                      images, in their constraints of how much text you can
                      put on them, often leave out the citations or the
                      references or where they're getting this information
                      from. Which is a whole other conversation to have.</span
                    >
                    And so thinking about the text-based nature of
                    <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> website, I
                    think you're totally spot on in that we wanted to create a
                    website that isn't (technically) resource heavy, that's
                    not going to take too long to load. And also,
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >in the sense of how Ritu and I collaborate, we often
                      tend to work with text. In some of the more oral history
                      oriented projects, we've worked with transcriptions from
                      interviews that I conducted. And
                      <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> is
                      definitely falling in line with this sort of
                      compilation</span
                    >
                    of … basically summaries of all this citational research
                    around surveillance that I was referencing earlier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as our collaboration style goes, it's kind of funny
                    actually to talk about how Ritu and I collaborate.
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >We have a very chaotic and energetic, like rapid fire,
                      iterating-as-we're-going type style.</span
                    >
                    I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we're
                    both very much so like contract workers and have a lot of
                    separate gigs in order to sustain our survival here in New
                    York. So often times when we're working on projects, like
                    <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a>, or, more
                    oral history oriented projects, which align with things
                    that we do outside of corporations or outside of
                    institutions… The only way to put is that they basically
                    support our living. And it's not always centered or
                    grounded in any type of passion or any type of deep
                    engagement in work. At least I'll speak for myself on that
                    part. So when we get to do projects, like
                    <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a>, I think
                    we're often coming to those projects exhausted. We're
                    coming to those projects deeply engaged with the
                    materiality of those projects. So …
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >we sort of “roll into” projects</span
                    >. Like sort of like happenstance, serendipitously come on
                    some of these projects. Like for example, Ritu was talking
                    about earlier how some Twitter mutuals had hit me up about
                    this project that they were interested in doing. Or rather
                    actually, it was that I saw some Twitter mutuals were
                    trying to make a project, and I was like,
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >“Oh, I have experience with web design. I can help my
                      organizer friends who were in need of a web designer on
                      this project.” And so then I was like, “this would be
                      perfect to bring Ritu into,” as our collaborator-ship is
                      always growing.</span
                    >
                    And so <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> was
                    pretty much like that. It wasn't like we had this whole
                    conceptualization period and then we came into an idea
                    together. We were folded into friends of friends project,
                    and just helped out. With
                    <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a> specifically,
                    there were lots of FaceTime calls with other members of
                    the group, and then Ritu and I, since we were the two
                    people on web, we had our own FaceTime sessions and quick
                    iterative sessions where we were working in a
                    collaborative Figma document. Ritu came up with some
                    designs within a few days, and I gave some feedback, and
                    we made some slight changes. We agreed that this was the
                    design. From there I started coding the front-end. And
                    then once we started coding the front-end, we we're
                    encountering, “Oh, maybe we need to change the design a
                    little bit here, tweak it a little bit here.” Based off
                    how it actually like takes shape and form on the web. And
                    we had some text discussions about that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What Ritu and I do in general… we send each other things
                    that we're thinking about. <s class="edit">Like</s>
                    Screenshots, selfies, or photos,
                    or just any type of material references that we feel is in
                    line with the type of things that we strive to make, or at
                    least want to be—or imagine ourselves being in
                    conversation with. And so we have that ongoing thing
                    between the two of us in our friendship. And then when
                    we're working on projects, specifically, we'll send each
                    other like things as they develop in within the project
                    space itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    …
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the past… I'm thinking of the oral history projects
                    that we've done for The School for Poetic Computation. The
                    last one that we did was for
                    <a href="http://sfpc.io/code-societies/">Code Societies</a
                    >, which was in January of 2020. And similarly… well, This
                    time, there was more planning involved. There was more
                    intentionality and discussion around the structure and
                    maybe what the output would look like. Because the
                    previous oral history project that we did for The School
                    for Poetic Computation was for a summer camp in Detroit.
                    Where we literally … I was just on the ground on in
                    Detroit and knew I wanted to make a zine but didn't really
                    know what that zine would look like
                    <a
                      href="#detroit-zine1"
                      aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                      id="detroit-zine1-content"
                      class="footnote-link"
                    >
                      <s class="edit"
                        >or what kind of content would be in that zine.</s
                      ></a
                    >
                    And then, within the experiences that I was having in
                    Detroit, with the students and other teachers and other
                    community members, I was like,
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >“Oh! This is like an oral history project. I need to
                      interview people and capture their words. There’s no way
                      that I can be the singular voice of what's happening
                      here.”</span
                    >
                    <a
                      href="#ritu-detroit"
                      aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                      id="ritu-detroit-content"
                      class="footnote-link"
                    >
                      <s class="edit"
                        >And so once I realized that well into the session, I
                        was like, “Hey Ritu, I’m doing these interviews, I
                        need help designing because I can't interview and
                        design.” So we brought her into that project.</s
                      ></a
                    >
                    And <s class="edit">then</s> with
                    <a href="http://sfpc.io/code-societies/">Code Societies</a

                      >“Wow, we work so well together on the fly.”</span
                    >
                    So why not see how we do … <s class="edit">like</s> going
                    in at the beginning knowing that we’re both going to be
                    working to a similar end. Which is like the Poetic
                    Computation: Detroit zine. And giving us more room to be
                    more experimental. Knowing the idea of the sort of
                    compilation oral histories zine methodology that we have
                    created in Detroit. Seeing how we could build upon that

                    <span class="highlight"
                      >I think it's really difficult to answer this question
                      because we're still figuring out what it means to
                      collaborate with one another. And we're still very much
                      so experimental in the way that we approach our
                      collaborators-ship. It's always very fluid. And I think
                      the most important thing, at least for me, in terms of
                      our collaborator-ship is just how our friendship informs
                      that collaboration</span

                    And we are constantly wrestling and navigating through
                    that in our work.

                    on the
                    <a href="https://techzinefair.org/"
                      >Tech Zine Fair website</a
                    >. Is that is that correct?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I want to say I have really enjoyed the energy of what I
                    see as experimentation in these projects and really
                    curious to know more.

                  <p>
                    I'm so happy I didn't have to go first. Well, first of
                    all, it was kind of a trip… waiting for Neta to reply to
                    that message because I also feel like I don't have the
                    language, like the faculty, to quite talk about what we
                    do. So I was interested to hear what Neta had to say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I sent Neta this page of this book I have. The page is
                    from 
                    
                    <a
                      href="#zine"
                      aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                      id="zine-content"
                      class="footnote-link"
                    >
                    <s>this archive of zines from Germany in the 70s</s>
                    </a>.
                    And
                    they had this like psychedelic page that said,
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >“Think of your desires as realities.” And I sent it to
                      her and was like, “This would be an amazing class title,
                      like a course title for a class we could co-teach.”
                      Because I really feel that Neta and I have this amazing
                      chemistry. We work together in this rapid-fire
                      dream-state. If we can understand that what we each want
                      is fluid and changing, how can we help each other to do
                      the things we want to do and what continues to interest
                      us? Rather than taking projects as straightforward
                      prompts, how can we turn projects into what moves us and
                      inspires us at the time?</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like during this time, we were also teaching a zine
                    workshop to teachers at the Cornell Tech program during
                    quarantine. It was supposed to be a straightforward summer
                    zine workshop, but what we decided to do is
                    <a
                      href="#curriculum"
                      aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                      id="curriculum-content"
                      class="footnote-link"
                    >
                    put together a
                    curriculum that we're calling “Alternative Zine
                    Histories.”
                    </a>
                    So I was very inspired, and I collected
                    readings that I felt really aligned. And Neta collected,
                    like Ida B. Wells posters, like pamphlets—things that
                    aren't a part of the normative zine history that we think
                    should be included.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >Every time I work with Neta, our friendship informs
                      what we do. Specifically with the zine projects and the
                      course I'm talking about… I think Neta has an amazing
                      quality and faculty to contemporaneously synthesize
                      what's happening in front of her and how she wants to
                      lead a discussion.</span
                    >
                    And so with those zine projects, she was an educator in
                    both of those courses for a week or two weeks or so. And
                    then I was getting the material as the classes were
                    happening. I was designing a publication for the student
                    showcase. So I was contemporaneously designing what Neta
                    was bringing to me. And I think we both really enjoy how
                    invigorating these projects are. But at the same time, we
                    would love to have access to a grant or resources to slow
                    down so we can really think about what we would want to do
                    together moving forward.

                    Wow. Your collaboration sounds so beautiful, and I love
                    that you don't exactly know how to describe it. But
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >it almost sounds to me like, you're one organism
                      together</span
                    >. Or one of you does one thing and the other does the
                    other, but you have to be working at the same time to make
                    it happen. And I love the phrase, “Think of your desires
                    as realities,” is and I would totally love to take that
                    course if it becomes a course or whatever it becomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    …
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ok so, I just have a few specific questions about
                    <a href="http://maskon.zone">maskon.zone</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, I was just wondering about the
                    mysterious-but-inviting dot-shaped graphics in the lower
                    right hand corner. I was wondering how those came about.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, I was wondering about the colors that are used on
                    the site. I noticed it's a kind of brown and red and
                    white, I believe? I was wondering… how are those chosen?
                    And then zooming out…
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >How do you approach color on the web?</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    …
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And while we're at it, I also want to ask… is there
                    anything else you want to share that we haven't covered
                    yet about the website maskon.zone?

                  <p>
                    I really love this question. So the typeface for
                    maskon.zone is a type called “<a
                      href="http://velvetyne.fr/fonts/tiny/"
                      >Tiny</a
                    >” which is from an open source foundry called
                    <a href="http://velvetyne.fr/">Velvetyne</a>, which is
                    really great and you should check it out. So what I did
                    was I vectorized the title, and I brought it into
                    Illustrator, and I tore apart the type to make the design
                    pattern at the bottom. I tried a lot of different things,
                    but that's what it came out to. And I felt like that was
                    the final touch because
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >I like this idea of bringing magic to websites</span
                    >, and I hope that everything I can make on the web has a
                    quality of magic toward it. So I like this like mystical
                    but inviting phrase because that's exactly what I wanted
                    to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The color scheme … there's not much to it. I mean, I just
                    I liked it. I think it's fun that when you highlight text,
                    you get a hot pink, and that was initially the color that
                    we were going with. I think it's a complement the brown,
                    but it changed to an orange. So then when you highlight
                    things, you get a slightly different orange hue which is
                    like a cute easter egg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    …
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And I also want to add…
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >as I’m making websites, and I think Neta can speak to
                      this too. I really like thinking about how information
                      flows.</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So for this for this website, we used an encrypted note
                    taking website called
                    <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a>. So like the
                    group had already organized all of their research into a
                    doc on <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a>, then
                    Neta organized the back-end on
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets">Google Sheets</a>,
                    and then we export it the
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets">Google Sheets</a>
                    to a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> back-end,
                    which then I posted on
                    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
                    (free) and bought the domain on
                    <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. So
                    <span class="highlight"
                      >I wish it were a totally encrypted journey</span
                    >, but we had to post on
                    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> just
                    for resource reasons. But the
                    <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a> to
                    <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> to
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets">Google Sheets</a>
                    to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a fun
                    journey for me.

                    intuitively. But I was also specifically wondering about
                    the colors on the "<a
                      href="https://soundsaboutriso.online"
                      >Sounds About Riso</a
                    >" site. I know you published that earlier this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I would guess that the colors are inspired by risograph
                    printing. I was just curious if you had any words to go
                    along with your color choice.

                      and aren’t austere. So I guess “funky” is a good way to
                      describe it—I think it's fun to be funky on the

                    For the “<a href="https://soundsaboutriso.online"
                      >Sounds About Riso</a
                    >” website, we worked together to select the gradients
                    that we wanted to accompany each page. It was really fun.
                    The whole site is gesturing toward what a physical fair
                    experience would be. But it is a second hand
                    representation of a fair … like there are walls and
                    tables. So it was really cool to think about the
                    dimensionality of the colors and being super intentional
                    about it. What made it look like the CSS rectangle on the
                    lower half of the screen was protruding like a table.
                    Yeah, thinking about color on the web is so fun. And I'm
                    really attracted to people who do it in unorthodox ways.

                    And later informed the industry that I ended up working
                    in. But I would say that I didn't go to school to learn
                    how to code until later in my life. I was a student at the
                    School of Poetic Computation in the fall of 2018. And
                    that's where I <s class="edit">really solidified my</s>

                    In <s class="edit">some</s>
                    many ways, I’m not so solid on
                    that. I'm still figuring it out. But since then, I've been
                    making a lot more websites and interested in making more
                    websites.

                    I really like the span because in other aspects of my
                    practice, like working with Python and working with
                    JavaScript… I like to create

                    JavaScript, I'll use the span tag

                I don't like the word activist because it often gets
                conflated with organizer and doesn't describe what I do.
                Regardless of their similarities, organizing and activism
                are two different things. Activism involves
                <em>individual advocacy</em> or speaking on issues of
                oppression that personally affect you while organizing
                inolves <em>being in collective struggle</em> or working
                with other people to take action against oppression. What
                I and most people I organize with do is organizing, not
                activism. Mariame Kaba explained the distinction between
                being an activist and an organizer best in "<a

                This is incorrect, I misspoke. I knew the content for the
                zine would consist of writing regarding what the students
                where experiencing within the class curriculum.

                I misspoke again. Before I went to Detroit, myself and the
                team knew it would be too much for me to design and
                generate content for the zine. So, Ritu was brought on on
                as a designer before—not during the session, albeit with
                limited knowledge regarding the content. Overall, our
                collaboration during the session was somewhat erratic
                because the content was generated in real time, within a
                short timeframe. This pacing generated some confusion,
                which is partly why I incorrectly remembered what actually
                happened.

                This is a much loved book of mine that's faded into my library, why I couldn't even remember its name, <a href="https://spectorbooks.com/under-the-radar-reprint">Under the Radar (Reprint) Underground Zines and Self-Publications 1965 – 1975</a> published by Spector Books. It's a design and culture resource for archival images and texts from underground zine culture in the 60s/70s. It's thoroughly researched but also has its ear to the ground – I felt like this book opened up new worlds for me!

                To clarify, I studied media studies with a specialization
                in journalism in undergrad. I briefly minored in graphic
                design before dropping the minor. I continued to study
                design independently outside of an institutional learning
                environment.

                I corrected myself because I'm practicing not using
                language that reifies master/slave or command and control
                logic within programming. Here, I don't see my
                collaboration with the computer as a manipulation, but
                rather an act of play where I tease out the options the
                computer's programming language has for me.

                When I came out of school, I had some full-time roles in the arts and startups where I didn't feel listened to or supported to the extent in which I believe workplaces should. I left those full-time jobs a bit traumatized by the collateral damage that employees, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, have to navigate for the companies they work for. In hopes of finding a bit more autonomy and inspiration, I started to pick up coding simple websites, and for now, I work for myself full time designing and coding.

                As Neta said, websites are just one of many powerful tools organizers use. However, often the best technology is on the ground organizing — “using our voices, using our networks of neighbors and friends and community members.”
